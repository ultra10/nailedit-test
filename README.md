# Game Developer Assignment: 5x3 Slot Machine

## Objective
Create a simple 5x3 slot machine game using TypeScript/JavaScript ES6 and Pixi.js. This assignment will test your
ability to work with game development concepts, TypeScript/JavaScript, and the Pixi.js library.

*Good luck with creating your slot machine game!*

## Requirements

### Game Mechanics
1. Implement a 5x3 grid of symbols.
2. Use the provided symbol images for the slot machine.
3. Implement a "Spin" button that randomizes the symbols on the grid.
4. Implement win condition checking for 3OAKs (3 consecutive symbols of the same kind).

### Visual Requirements
1. Use Pixi.js to render the game.
2. Create a basic, visually appealing layout for the slot machine.
3. Implement a spinning reels visualization during the spin action.
4. Implement a simple win animation (e.g., a "bump" or highlight effect on winning symbols).

### Technical Requirements
1. Use TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 for all game logic.
2. Use Pixi.js for rendering and animations.
3. Implement a basic state management system (e.g., idle, spinning, win checking).
4. Ensure the code is well-organized, following object-oriented programming principles.
6. Feel free to install any dependency you might find useful.
7. Feel free to modify any of boilerplate/template files if needed (files on root).

## Build & Development

You will need node setup on your machine.

Then you can run the commands below in order to start the client:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

That will build the game and start a client at http://localhost:8080/. The server has hot reload, so every time you 
update the code, it should rebuild the client and refresh the tab in your preferred web browser.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality, organization, and readability
- Effective use of TypeScript/JavaScript ES6 and Pixi.js
- Correct implementation of required game mechanics
- Quality of spinning reels visualization and win animation
- Overall user experience and game feel
